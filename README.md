# NoSQL_Challenge
In this challenge I used NoSQL database to analyze the query for establishments where the first step of the process involves connecting to a MongoDB instance using the MongoClient object from the pymongo library. After establishing the connection, the script assigns the desired database and collection (in this case, uk_food and establishments) to variables. Queries are constructed to filter the database for specific criteria, such as hygiene scores, rating values, or geographic locations. For example, the code searches for establishments with a hygiene score of 20 or those located in London with a rating value of 4 or higher. Once the query is defined, the count_documents method is used to count the results, and find_one is used to display a sample result for verification.

Next, the results of the queries are converted into lists and stored in Pandas DataFrames, a format that facilitates easy data manipulation and analysis. The DataFrames are then exported to CSV files, which allows for long-term storage and external analysis. The script also includes more advanced queries using MongoDB's aggregation framework, applying match, group, and sort operations to find how many establishments in each local authority area have a hygiene score of 0. This method effectively transforms raw MongoDB query results into a structured, analyzable format, making it possible to explore patterns and trends in the dataset.
